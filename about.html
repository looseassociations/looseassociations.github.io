                Loose Associations is a mixed-media collective run by Finn Murphy, Emma Cheung and pals. Only on the cusp of psychosocial meltdown do we put out what would otherwise stay in. We make zines and tees and films and music. You know what they say: variety is the vice of life. And: society is the spice of strife. We don’t aim to be ambiguous but we don’t try to be specific. Each of our creations is a collaborative effort to make accessible art about our surroundings. And the surroundings always change.
                <br/><br/>
                Our back catalogue of publications is in the <a href="/index.html">archive</a>. Most are out of print but remaining stock is <a href="https://looseassociations.myshopify.com/" target="_blank"> available for purchase</a>. Stay tuned for future projects.
                <br/><br/>
                We have carried out zine workshops with Southbank Centre, Young Records and Bethlem Gallery. We also offer a screen-printing service - we've printed tees for Cipher Press, Peninsula Press, Sympathy, Blank and more. If you’re interested in making a zine with your writers group or printing tees for your thing then <a href="/contact.html">send us an email</a>.
