                Loose Associations is a mixed media collective run by Finn Murphy, Emma Cheung and pals. Our creations combine our collective skills - writing, filmmaking, painting, printing, drawing, book-binding and photography. Our interests revolve around the landscape, food, observational comedy, the absurd and the ordinary. Jack of all trades, master of some; hands in all the pies and liking the sensation.
                <br/><br/>
                Our aim as a collective is to make accessible and democratic art that constructs an intimate relationship to the present; paying attention to our surroundings and fixing our focus on the idiosyncratic and impermanent. By creatively acknowledging our landscapes, environmental and political, we can change them.
                <br/><br/>
                We have carried out zine workshops with Southbank Centre, Young Records and The Greenhouse Theatre. If you would like to arrange a workshop with us <a href="/contact.html" target="_blank">get in touch</a>!
                <br/> <br/>
                We take commissions for printing and designing services - zines, pamphlets, posters, t-shirts and more. Check out our <a href="archive.html">archive</a> to see if this will suit your project. We offer digital printing, bookmaking and screen-printing - <a href="/contact.html" target="_blank">get in touch</a> if you have any questions.
                <br/> <br/>
                We have worked our practice into neat little consumables available to buy from our <a href="shop.html" target="_blank">online shop</a> and our canalside shop, which we operate from our narrowboat. Follow our <a href="https://www.instagram.com/looseassociations/">instagram</a> for updates on location and opening times.
